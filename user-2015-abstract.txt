CRAN is serving us well as the main point of distributing
R packages, and has been one of the main reasong behind
the success of R.

METACRAN is an experiment to provide additional services
on top of the CRAN infrastructure:
 - A searchable code mirror, with diffs between package
   versions, and the ability to create personalized versions
   of R packages.
 - A database and API of CRAN metadata.
 - A package search engine and web site for package discovery.
 - A package manager.
 - A continuous integration wrapper to build and check
   R packages with various R versions.
 - A database and API of CRAN package downloads
   from the cloud CRAN mirror.
In this presentation I briefly introduce these services.

Note that METACRAN is not a CRAN project, and it is developed and
maintained independently of CRAN.
